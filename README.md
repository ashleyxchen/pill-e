# pill-e
hack the north project <br />
Paired with a robot built with Raspberry-pi, pill-e can be set up in just a few button clicks, where the user can indicate which pills should be taken on which days and times. The output of the pills is controlled using customized pill filtering containers powered by continuous servo motors and an LED-photoresistor setup.

A camera with a view of the tray of dispensed pills is integrated into pill-e for the purpose of connecting with the app, providing an option for caretakers to keep an eye on the status of the medication ingestion if they so choose. The screen at the top of pill-e features an animated smiley face, providing a friendly element to the user experience.
